# The Golden Dungeon

In a small dimension in the outer reaches of the multiverse a wizard tower
is erected - to point out the direction of success. Inside the wizard tower
dwells the wizard, it is here the *Grand Plan* is being worked out. To the
wizard, success is a matter of having a *Grand Plan*, the grander the
better; whether the *Grand Plan* actually ever succeeds is another matter
entirely - whoever would expect an insanely impossibly *Grand Plan* to be
fullfilled; and should it against all reason do so, nobody else believe it
anyway.

It is a secret and unspoken rule between wizards to never talk amongst each
other about their *Grand Plans*, and therefore they have invented a game to test
how far each and everyone have come in their planning, without freely giving
any secrets up. It's a game where they send their team of champions to battle
another wizard's team in a *Golden Dungeon* - which isn't necessarily golden,
they just call it so. If the attacking team defeats the defending champions,
they break out from the dungeon, and get into the wizard tower to steal as
much as they can from the wizard's *Grand Plan*, in the hope of finding clues
how to make their own plan grander.

### Degrees

When wizards advance, they do it in degrees, which are separated into four
Orders: Initiate, Adept, Magus, and Grand Magus. Each Order has ten degrees.
Wizards of the Initiate Order may have no apprentices, Adepti may have
one apprentice, Magi two apprentices, and Grand Magi three apprentices. A
wizard's apprecntice is a kind of champion, in that to prepare for becoming
an initiate, the apprentice need to partake in many dungeon battles.

The more a wizard advances in degrees, the more power becomes accessible;
it could also be said that the more powerful a wizard becomes the higher
the degree of that wizard - it is a mystery which assessment is true, or
if both are.


### Wizard Schools

The wizard must select a school of magic; there are 6 to choose from:

* [Mystic](#markdown-header-mystic)
* [Magician](#markdown-header-magician)
* [Sorceror](#markdown-header-sorceror)
* [Witch](#markdown-header-witch)
* [Warlock](#markdown-header-warlock)
* [Necromancer](#markdown-header-necromancer)

Wizards don't bother much about genders, or races, or species; they mostly
care about magic, and how to attain the *Grand Plan*. Therefore, female,
male, or anything in between type of wizards, are happily accepted in all
schools. Nobody actually knows what the wizards looks like beneath those
pointy hats of theirs; what's important is how many stars and moon crescents
the hats have, because that is the number of spells they know - wizards
usually only remember grudges, and use their hats for remembering anything
else.

#### Mystic

The mystic school is associated with the colours *white* and *gold*; their
adepts are in direct contact with the divine, they are experts on healing
and blessings, and pray to their gods for favours. The mystic's prefered
worker is a gift from their deity, a little guardian angel.

#### Magician

The magician school is associated with the colours *yellow* and *purple*;
their adepts prefer collecting books in great libraries, they store a
multitude of spells there, and are exceptionally skilled at performing
complicated rituals, with many arcane symbols. The magician's prefered
worker is the house elf, which they usually keep for generations.

#### Sorceror

The sorceror school is associated with the colours *orange* and *blue*;
their adepts draws power from the source itself, the classical elements.
They can use powerful spells, which are created from pure energy. The
sorceror's prefered worker is an earth elemental, the gnome.

#### Witch

The witch school is associated with the colours *green*, *brown* and *black*;
their adepts are in contact with nature. They know how to talk to animals, and
can call upon the spirits of animals, trees and stones to do their bidding.
The witch's prefered worker is a toadstool fairy.

#### Warlock

The warlock school is associated with the colour *red* and *green*; their
adepts are talented in controlling the chaos of the universe, they invoke
the powers of demons and other sinister forces. The warlock's prefered worker
is an imp.

#### Necromancer

The necromancer school is associated with the colours *black* and more *black*;
their adepts communicate with the spirits of the dead. They can summon the
dead to rise from the grave, and command ghosts and vampires, and other undead
creatures. The necromancer's prefered worker is the dependable Igor.


## The Houses

Around the wizard tower are built houses inhabited by all kinds of
creatures. To summon a creature, a house needs to be built, where the
creature can live when it's not in the dungeon. The larger the house
is, the more creatures it can house, and all they do is sleep and eat
and play cards, and go on vacation to meet old relatives and such
things. If the tower is attacked, they don't notice anything, because
they are so busy whith what they are doing at the moment.

If a house is destroyed, its inhabitants will move away down into the
mine again; and including those champions in the dungeon, because they
also need a house to rest.

A house can only host one type of creature, and all creatures require
their type of house, e.g. a unicorn would never stay anywhere but in
a unicorn stable, nor would a goblin live but in a cozy goblin
hole-in-the-ground - they would naturally find it offensive to suggest
living anywhere else - who wouldn't.


## The Mine

In the mine the wizard's workers go in their spare time, because they love
to dig for treasures. Once they find a treasure, they return to the wizard
to proudly present their finding for evaluation and gratification - there
is nothing more pleasing to a wizard's worker than to hear it has done a
good job; it then happily go to find more treasures. To read about treasures -
see [resources](#markdown-header-the-resources).

Sometimes creatures are found in the dungeon, and brought home by the
workers; they will stay for a while unless a house is built for them to
move into. If they have a house to live, offspring eventually comes, which
the wizard can train as champions - all champions must be trained from
young age to be of any use in dungeon battles.

There is also a small chance of finding formulas for creating objects. Any
formula found is collected in the wizard's library - a place only the wizard
knows where it is. While studying formulas to better understand them,
wizards make copies which they have on their desks, in case the formula
would get stolen - for example, by another wizard looting the tower - to
ensure no risk of ever losing any original formula.


## The Dungeon

In the dungeon is a maze filled with deadly traps of many kinds, and other
objects. It is also inhabited by the wizard's team of champions.

### Dungeon Objects

The wizard may build any amount of traps and other items that can be afforded,
and design the dungeon layout with them. Building the items take time however,
and is limited by the number of workers employed by the wizard. Building
objects require a formula for the object - which is obtained either by
the workers while digging in the mine, or by looting other wizard towers.
Wizards can only construct objects from formulas they have enough magical
understanding to comprehend - which they attain by advancing in degrees.


## The Champions

The wizard's champions can be of many types of creatures, but natural enemies
will not work well together, and regularly attack each other at sight, making
them lousy team mebers. This puts a limit to the composition of teams. The
champions never actually die when beaten, they are only temporarily banished
and need to rest to be fit for the next fight. 

A champion live an ordinary life and is quite happy in the dungeon. Their
greatest pleasure however is to make battle with other champions. When they
battle, they gain in experience and strength, and may over time become quite
powerful and skilled. Each creature have their own advantages and
disadvantages, and so building a team is a matter of matching those to the
other members of the team.

Once trained, a champion remains in the dungeon, or in it's house resting,
or on vacation; but in case the wizard desides there are too many champions
to feed, it can be sent away - and then moves down into the mine, never to
return again.

## The Resources

There are several kinds of resources. Gold is used as the universal currency,
when dealing with any creatures. It is of course not ordinary physical gold
we are talking abaout, but *alchemical gold* - which is a substance of the
most purified and vital energy. In the magical dimension where the wizard
lives, gold is used to pay salaries for building objects, to summon champion
creatures, and to make them advance and become more powerful.

There are also various treasures collected from the [mine](#markdown-header-the-mine),
or from looting other wizard towers. These can be materials to be
used in alchemy, or for constructing certain objects.


## The Battle

Because of wizards' honour - which is sacred even to the most depraved or
sinister kind of wizard - it is not permitted to attack any wizard who's
champions are resting from a previous attack; it is also unthinkable for
any wizard to attack any other wizard who's tower has been looted, until it
has been properly put back in order, or disorder depending on the wizard,
and that usually takes quite a lot of time - because wizards are meticulous
about such things.

When the wizard tower is in good shape, and the dungeon is prepared, it may
be attacked by another wizard's team of champions. The attacking wizard
then opens a dimension gateway into the dungeon, and the champions jump
through, eager and ready for battle.

To open a portal, a wizard must be of at least initiate degree; the spell
is only taught to initiates, because it requires an astoundishing amount of
magical power. Once the gateway is opened, it leads to an in-between-dimension
which is completely void except for a small, circular, flat and infinitely
thin platform. The radius of this platform depends on how powerful the
wizard is. All champions that will partake in the battle must go onto
this platform. Then another portal is opened leading to the target dungeon,
on the other side of the void dimension, and the platform is sent towards
it. It glides slowly and steadily; however, should any champions fall off,
they will certainly not be happy about it - for a very long time (it should
be noted that this hasn't happened yet, and is a topic for scolarly
discussion).

The portal may be placed anywhere in the dungeon, and it can also be
closed and opened in another location. The wizard commands which champions
go through when and in which order, but has after that no control at all
over the champions; however, spells may be cast to alter the way the battle
goes, and gold can be placed anywhere in the dungeon - which the champions
will go looking for.

The target of the attacking wizard's champions is to defeat all the defenders
and then find their way through the dungeon, through all its traps and
obstructions; and before time runs out, reach the dungeon exit. If at least
one champion reach the exit in time, the battle is won and the wizard tower
is looted. The more champions reach the exit, the higher the score and the
more is looted.

The portal can only be open for as long as the wizard has power to keep it
open. After that all champions are vanquished and has to return the same way
as defeated champions - by waking up in their beds as after an unpleasant
dream.
