## Champions

The Wizards' champions can be ordered into classes with general and
specific specialisations and skills; these classes refer to their
behaviour rather than characteristics such as health or strength.
The classes are:

* [Attacker](#markdown-header-attacker)
* [Defender](#markdown-header-defender)
* [Tank](#markdown-header-tank)
* [Destroyer](#markdown-header-destroyer)
* [Healer](#markdown-header-healer)
* [Digger](#markdown-header-digger)
* [Trapper](#markdown-header-trapper)
* [Specialist](#markdown-header-specialist)

All champions have telepathic communication within the team, since
they are magical creatures after all. Therefore, they can call each
other out if a specific champion is needed; unless they are already
engaged, they will go to the caller, otherwise they will ignore the
call until they are done.

## Classes

### Attacker

The attacker will seek out and attack all opponent champions
primarily. They are usually unable to dig through walls, and
if stuck in a room without exit will call
for [diggers](#markdown-header-digger). If there are hostile
constructions, such as traps, in line of sight, and no visible
enemies, they will attack those, but firstly enemy champions;
otherwise they will seek enemies out. If there are both enemies
and hostile constructions in line of sight, they will call
for [destroyers](#markdown-header-destroyer).

### Defender

Place them in a spot and they will stay there and defend that
spot, no matter what happens. Often they stay inside some kind
of defensive construction, such as a small tower.

### Tank

The tank simply moves towards anything dangerous, and soaks up
damage.

### Destroyer

The destroyer focuses on seeking out and destroying constructions,
including traps and walls. If attacked, they will defend themselves.

### Healer

The healer will seek out any champion that has taken damage and
heal. When any champion has less than 25% health, they will call
for a healer, then the healer will move towards the caller, and
if there are more than one caller - towards the closest caller.
If attacked, they only continue healing. They cannot heal themselves
but they can heal other healers.

### Digger

The digger diggs through walls and creates paths between rooms
for champions to move through. While digging through the dungeon
they may find resources and treasures. Once they start digging,
they only go one direction, until they come out another path or
reach the end of the map. If called for, and they current
engagement hasn't been called for previously, they will abandon
their digging and go to the caller; otherwise they will ignore
the call until they are done. If they reach the end of the map,
they are done with their task, and will go to any caller. If
there are no callers, they will dig in any direction. If called
while digging, they will not dig towards the caller, unless they
cannot go there without digging - then they will ignore the call.
If attacked, they will defend themselves.

### Trapper

The trapper will seek out all traps and hostile constructions.
They are experts on arming and disarming traps. If there are enemy
traps, they will disarm then firstly, secondly they will place
traps in their close perimiter, and move about randomly. If attacked,
they defend themselves.

### Specialist

The specialists all have a specialist skill they do, and they
can do nothing else. The skill is individual to the type
of specialist, and there can be many types. If attacked, the
specialist only continue what they do, and does not try to
defend.
