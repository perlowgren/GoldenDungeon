			<h1>The Golden Dungeon</h1>

			<p>In a small dimension in the outer reaches of the multiverse a wizard tower
			is erected - to point out the direction of success. Inside the wizard tower
			dwells the wizard, it is here the <em>Grand Plan</em> is being worked out. To the
			wizard, success is a matter of having a <em>Grand Plan</em>, the grander the
			better; whether the <em>Grand Plan</em> actually ever succeeds is another matter
			entirely - whoever would expect an insanely impossibly <em>Grand Plan</em> to be
			fullfilled; and should it against all reason do so, nobody else believe it
			anyway.</p>

			<p>It is a secret and unspoken rule between wizards to never talk amongst each
			other about their <em>Grand Plans</em>, and therefore they have invented a game to test
			how far each and everyone have come in their planning, without freely giving
			any secrets up. It's a game where they send their team of champions to battle
			another wizard's team in a <em>Golden Dungeon</em> - which isn't necessarily golden,
			they just call it so. If the attacking team defeats the defending champions,
			they break out from the dungeon, and get into the wizard tower to steal as
			much as they can from the wizard's <em>Grand Plan</em>, in the hope of finding clues
			how to make their own plan grander.</p>

			<p>The game is in early development, this is what we have so far (see above, click image
			for full size). Development started March 22, 2016; no release date has been set as of
			today (April 10, 2016).</p>
