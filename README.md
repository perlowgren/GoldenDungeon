# The Golden Dungeon

In a small dimension in the outer reaches of the multiverse a wizard tower
is erected - to point out the direction of success. Inside the wizard tower
dwells the wizard, it is here the *Grand Plan* is being worked out. To the
wizard, success is a matter of having a *Grand Plan*, the grander the
better; whether the *Grand Plan* actually ever succeeds is another matter
entirely - whoever would expect an insanely impossibly *Grand Plan* to be
fullfilled; and should it against all reason do so, nobody else believe it
anyway.

It is a secret and unspoken rule between wizards to never talk amongst each
other about their *Grand Plans*, and therefore they have invented a game to test
how far each and everyone have come in their planning, without freely giving
any secrets up. It's a game where they send their team of champions to battle
another wizard's team in a *Golden Dungeon* - which isn't necessarily golden,
they just call it so. If the attacking team defeats the defending champions,
they break out from the dungeon, and get into the wizard tower to steal as
much as they can from the wizard's *Grand Plan*, in the hope of finding clues
how to make their own plan grander.

## About

The Golden Dungeon is a dungeon defence game, primarily for Android devices. The
game play is similar to titles such as *Clash of Clans*, though the differences are
vast. Each player design their own dungeon, which can be attacked by other players.
There are elements of RPG, champions are collected and while battling opponents
upgrade their skills and gears.
